      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        WHY MY SITE?
        People will come to my site because it will teach them how to cook a good meal with a desert. The main page will have a description along with pictures and will lead to a child page for a main meal and another child page for a desert. It is easy to use and understand. The website will show all the steps for a main course meal along with a picture. The desert will also have septs on how to make the desert with a picture.

        WHY COME TO MY SITE?
        Visitors will have the question, how do I make this and what will I need, and both those questions will be answered on the page. Visitors will want to cook the meal and desert on the webpage. It is not a hard meal to make yet it will taste great! The ingredients and the recipe are the only information necessary for users to complete the activity. Users will want to use my website rather than others because mine will be very simple and user friendly. It will be as simple as a piece of paper with the recipe, but it will cleaner and nicer than just a simple piece of paper. 

        LAYOUT OF THE SITE
        The websites home page will be simple and will have the logo in the center. It will have a Nav bar (most of which will not work because of time) but the Nav bar will have Home, Main Dishes, Desserts, Drinks, and a Search function. Below the Nav bar, there will be a Header that says Meal of the Week. This meal of the week will have the child pages linked. The first picture will show the main dish along with the name. This picture will have a hover function and can light up. You can click on the image, and it will take you to the child page where it will have the recipe and directions along with other pictures. You will be able to do the same for the other options. Next to the Main dish, there will a desert picture and you can click on this image and get the same results as the main dish, just for the recipe. The layout will be similar to the Dry Oar website for the home page. All three pictures will be side by side and have a boarder and background to it. There will be a sub header under the picture that says, “Main Dish” “Dessert” & “Drink”. There will also be a footer that will have a Contact Us link, as well as a link to Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. It will look similar to the Dry Oar footer.

      <h3>Main dish
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think I will be making egg sandwiches on bagels for the Main meal. I am deciding to go with a breakfast dinner for the website. I think the frozen hot cholate will go well with the breakfast meal. There will be instructions on how to make this along with all the ingredients needed. I will have a picture for both the ingredients and the final product.
